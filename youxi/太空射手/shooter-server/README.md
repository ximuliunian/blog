![shooter](./shooter.png)

[shooter.io][1] is a network based multiplayer space shooter game.

## shooter-server

`shooter-server` is a Go program that runs a universe for space ships that can
shoot and destroy each other.

It also accepts incoming websockets connections, assigns each connection its
own ship, and lets the user control her ship.

You can build and run the server with:

```
make docker-run
```

## shooter-html5

The [shooter-html5][2] repo is a HTML5 client that uses canvas, JavaScript and
Websockets to display whatever is happening on `shooter-server`.

## Current state

* This project was never finished, code is messy, racy and undocumented. I
  don't have plans to continue working on this again anytime soon...
* I'd like to create a native client for mobile too.
* I'd like to experiment with UDP messages instead of TCP websockets.
